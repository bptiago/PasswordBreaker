# Password Manager

<b>This was made solely for educational purposes!</b>

This is a Java program for generating random secure passwords and also breaking unsalted SHA-256 hashs.

The hashes are broken by brute force trough trial and error of all possible combinations to a set number of characters.

This is a comand line application, so you need to execute Main.java and insert the inputs as the program instructs.
